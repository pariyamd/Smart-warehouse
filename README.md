# Smart-warehouse
A small IoT project which reads the temperature of the room and sends the temperature to a server using a simcard. The project is designed for a smart warehouse and it is implemented by an arduino and a sim800l module.

the implementation starts with connecting arduino-uno, sim800l module, the resistor which measures temperature and a DC to DC convertor(LM2596),they should be connected as followed:
